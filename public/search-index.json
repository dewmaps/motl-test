[{"content":"<p>Lines are the foundation of the visual language of maps. Take, for instance, the map on your phone that guides you between two places: one main line grabs your attention and encourages you to ignore the rest of the map. For centuries, mapmakers have experimented with the placement, density, and purpose of lines like these to make maps seem simple and objective. Just follow this line and you’ll have everything you need—or so the map leads you to believe. These lines are never as straightforward as they seem. This exhibition follows lines on maps to their extremes. By exploring how maps use lines to make the world legible, the exhibition will bring you through examples of mapmakers and artists who have created, bent, and broken these linear rules. By following these lines, you will find maps to be more complex and more motley than they ever imagined!</p>\n","length":147,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"http://localhost:8080/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Contents","type":"table-of-contents","url":"http://localhost:8080/contents/"},{"abstract":"","content":"<p>Here, you can write in Markdown, which is a simple, plain-text markup language that uses basic symbols, such as hash marks, asterisks, and brackets, to format content for easy conversion into HTML.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the things you can do with Markdown:</p>\n<p>Add italics to a word or phrase by surrounding it with single asterisks: <em>a phrase in italics</em>.<br>\nAdd bold to a word or phrase by surrounding it with double asterisks: <strong>a phrase in bold</strong>.<br>\nAdd a second-level heading by putting the text on it’s own line, preceded by two hashmarks: ## Heading 2.<br>\nAdd a link by putting the link text in square brackets followed by the URL in parentheses: [click here] (<a href=\"http://www.myurl.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.myurl.com</a>).</p>\n<p>You can also use footnotes in your text using Markdown, which will appear at the bottom of the page.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Memorandum draft by Walker Evans, reproduced in <em>Walker Evans at Work</em>, (New York: Harper and Row, 1982), 112. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Walker Evans to Ernestine Evans, unfinished two-page letter in black ink on hotel stationery, dated Feb. 1934, first published in <em>Walker Evans at Work</em>, 98.

Published in 1918, around the time of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the first World War, this period was a tumultuous time for national borders in Europe. State officials, scientists, and academics believed that peace could be secured and that any lingering conflicts could be solved through the ethnographic map.</p>\n<p>As early as 1914, France began to set up geographical commissions to start charting potential territorial issues and creating ethnographic maps with the intention of using them as major aids in decision making during peace negotiations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Isaiah Bowman, one of the leaders of the U.S. delegation to the Paris Peace Conference was quoted as saying “each one of the Central European nationalities had its own bagful of statistical and cartographical tricks. When statistics failed, use was made of maps in color. It would take a huge monograph to contain an analysis of all the types of map forgeries that the war and the peace conference called forth.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> The war was not only an effort to resolve imperial competition and anxieties but also an attempt to resolve questions about European nationalism.</p>\n<p>Ethnographic maps like the <em>Carte Ethnographique</em> claimed to be objective but were influenced by the political beliefs of their creators, the needs of the state, and flaws in statistical sciences and data collection in this period. For example, German mapmakers continually struggled to define who would count as German when collecting census data and representing that on maps—should birthplace or current citizenship determine whether someone was categorically German? Did either of those characteristics mean that someone felt belonging or loyalty to a German state? Though scholars eventually settled on shared language as the most essential quality of German-ness, even that decision required arbitrary decisions that were not always standardized across cartographers—should they count the language someone spoke at home or the language they as their primary language? Should someone’s “mother tongue” determine whether they should be marked on a map as German or not?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Looking at the <em>Carte Ethnographique</em>, notice which groups are labeled, the size of their territorial claims, and what colors Gabrys chose to represent them. Examine the size of Lithuanian territory and the variety in types of Lithuanians, and how Lithuanians are represented. Their group appears in bold red colors that stand out against the pale blues of the Poles and browns of the Russians, and is one of the brightest colors on the entire map. By emphasizing the population and unique history of Lithuanians by highlighting different groups and his choice of a bold color, Gabrys revealed some of his political and personal biases.</p>\n<p>Gabrys wanted Lithuanians to be internationally recognized as a large and powerful ethnic group that deserved its own nation, separate from surrounding countries. He had been politically active before the first World War and played an important role in Lithuanian nationalist movements as in 1905, when he was an active part of the Lithuanian revolution against Russia and had to flee in the following year. By 1910, he had written several books about Lithuania, hoping to show to his readers that Lithuania had a unique history and a distinct culture that merited a separate nation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> In 1911, Gabrys founded the Offices des Nationalités in 1911 to give Lithuanians and other ethnic minorities, who he saw as oppressed by larger countries, a chance to express their identities and problems. By 1918, when his <em>Carte Ethnographique de l’Europe</em> was published, Gabrys had already organized multiple conferences in France that brought together people from around the world to make their own claims about ethnicity and nation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Gabrys also revealed his support for Polish claims after the war. He marked what became known as the “Polish Corridor” as being populated by Poles, bolstering their position against Germany. After WWI, the Allies had recognized Poland as an independent state and included the Polish Corridor as part of that territory. Germans were outraged by this decision, especially since it cut East Prussia off from the rest of their territory, arguing that Polish communities were extremely minor influences in the area.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> Popular maps played an extremely important role in public discourse surrounding this debate on both Polish and German sides, and Polish claims to the corridor would have been bolstered by maps like this one by Gabrys.</p>\n<p>Viewing the map as a whole, the contemporary borders of European nations, outlined in black dotted lines, do not match up with the lines or shapes marking ethnic groups and nationalities. Some groups had more than 12 different nationalities within their borders, such as Russia, and other countries with relatively cohesive ethnic groups were missing parts of their group as it fanned out into a different nation, like Italy. By spatializing these relationships on his map, Gabrys made ethnic groups more visible and emphasized that political borders on maps did not always reflect the reality of the world.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Gilles Palsky, “Emmanuel de Martonne and the Ethnographical Cartography of Central Europe (1917–1920),” <em>Imago Mundi</em> 54, no. 1 (January 2002): 111–19. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/03085690208592961\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1080/03085690208592961</a>. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Quoted in Palsky, “Emmanuel de Martonne,” 113. <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jason D.

A lo menos la Francia y la Inglaterra están separadas por el canal de la Mancha; entre nuestra nación y la vecina no existe otro lindero que una simple línea matemática…………¡Dios salve á la República!!!</em>” -Antonio García Cubas, <strong>Diccionario geográfico, histórico y biográfico de los Estado Unidos Mexicanos</strong>, 1898</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Writing toward the end of his career, Antonio García Cubas, one of the most important cartographers of Mexico, expressed concern over the lack of a clear, natural geographic border between Mexico and a land-hungry United States to the north. Having witnessed the Mexican American War that ended in 1848, when the United States forced Mexico to cede almost one-third of its territory, García Cubas recognized the influential role national maps could play in disputes over territory and nation. His quote from the end of the century—that Mexico’s “history is written simply by saying that Mexico and the United States are neighbors. At least France and England are separated by the Channel; between our nation and our neighbor there exists no other border than a simple mathematic line…God help the Republic!”—reflected his repeated efforts throughout his career to map the nation of Mexico and to present it as a unified nation with an inherent shared culture and history.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Take, for example, García Cubas’s 1863 <em>Carta general de la República</em>. Usually, we think of borders as being made up of one line. Yet this map has two northern borders. This map was another version of a map from one of García Cubas’s earlier atlases, produced on a much larger scale. Measuring almost 4 feet by 5 feet, this map was the first national map of Mexico made in Mexico by a Mexican cartographer. In this map, not only did García Cubas present a unified nation, but he also commented upon the relationship between the Untied States and Mexico by including two different northern borders of Mexico. One border is marked by text, in Spanish, that reads “Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,” and includes the area known as the Mesilla Valley. The other is marked with “Treaty of La Mesilla” and is highlighted in red, following the contours of present-day Mexico.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://storiiies.cogapp.com/embed/0d6rb/Carta-General\" title=\"Carta General\"></iframe>\n<p>Published shortly after the U.S. had taken a large portion of Mexico’s territory with these two different treaties, backed by military force, the dual borders on this <em>Carta general</em> marked each land cession by Mexico, tying these international events to histories that defined the nation of Mexico. By presenting Mexico as a complete nation with natural borders, García Cubas argued that other nations like the U.S. should respect its territorial claims.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>Other versions of the map did not contain this double border. In the 1858 version, which was included in an atlas, García Cubas only outlined in red a single northern border and the map makes no mention of either the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo or Treaty of La Mesilla. <figure id=\"carta-general-58\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#carta-general-58\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/cartageneral58.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Antonio García Cubas <em>Carta general de la República Mexicana</em>, 1858.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">David Rumsey Historical Map Collection</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/cartageneral58.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Antonio García Cubas <em>Carta general de la República Mexicana</em>, 1858.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">David Rumsey Historical Map Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure> The difference between the atlas and the 1863 version perhaps suggests that Antonio García Cubas wanted to make a point about the power of cartography and Mexico as a nation when his map was published in larger format.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Translated quote from Raymond B.
