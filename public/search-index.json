[{"content":"<p><em>“One can make a map without shades and colors, but not without lines”</em><br>\n<em>-Erwin Raisz</em>, Principles of Cartography</p>\n<p>Lines are foundational to how maps communicate. Take, for instance, the map on your smart phone. To guide you between two places, the map shows one line and encourages you to ignore everything else. Mapmakers’ choices about the placement, density, and purpose of lines combine to make maps seem simple and objective— just follow this line and you’ll have everything you need. But these lines are rarely as straightforward as they seem. This exhibition follows lines on maps to their extremes in examples from seemingly mundane textbooks to avant-garde art. Through these lines, maps rationalize their world view, even as they reveal perspectives that are neither universal nor neutral.</p>\n<p>The exhibition’s seven sections each delve into a fundamental kind of line on maps as they developed in Europe and the Americas.

As these instructional texts illustrate, lines can have a variety of functions, even within one specific kind of map. A thin line may mark a minor road; an undulating line may track a river; and a straight line along the edges will often give the map itself a border. Although these lines now seem obvious, mapmakers developed these conventionalized, but still flexible, symbols slowly over time. By codifying these symbols, instructional texts like these spread a European tradition of mapping throughout the world.</p>\n<p>The amazing variety in types of lines is most apparent in texts that explicitly teach mapmaking, a few of which you can see in the examples below.</p>\n<figure id=\"conventionalsigns\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#conventionalsigns\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/conventionalsigns/colorconventionalsigns/static-inline-figure-image.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">From  <em>Manual of Topography and Text-book Of Tropographical Drawing; For the Use of Officers of the Army and Navy, Civil Engineers, Academies, Colleges, and Schools of Science</em> by Joseph Enthoffer, 1870.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Newberry Library</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/iiif/conventionalsigns/colorconventionalsigns/print-image.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">From  <em>Manual of Topography and Text-book Of Tropographical Drawing; For the Use of Officers of the Army and Navy, Civil Engineers, Academies, Colleges, and Schools of Science</em> by Joseph Enthoffer, 1870.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Newberry Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><em>Institutions Standardize Map Lines</em></p>\n<p>In this U.S. Coast Survey manual, engraver Joseph Entoffer carefully detailed the colors, shapes, and types of lines mapmakers should use to mark features important for military purposes.

Short, thick strokes show a steep pitch and long, thin strokes show a gradual incline. Mapmakers often combine hachure lines with crosshatching—the network of intersecting lines artists used in printmaking to create shading—to enhance the illusion of depth. Contour lines, in contrast, run perpendicular to the slope.

Published in 1918, around the time of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the first World War, this period was a tumultuous time for national borders in Europe. State officials, scientists, and academics believed that peace could be secured and that any lingering conflicts could be solved through the ethnographic map. As early as 1914, France began to set up geographical commissions to start charting potential territorial issues and creating ethnographic maps with the intention of using them as major aids in decision making during peace negotiations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ethnographic maps like the <em>Carte Ethnographique</em> claimed to be objective but were influenced by the political beliefs of their creators, the needs of the state, and flaws in statistical sciences and data collection in this period.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Looking at the <em>Carte Ethnographique</em>, notice which groups are labeled, the size of their territorial claims, and what colors Gabrys chose to represent them. Examine the size of Lithuanian territory and the variety in types of Lithuanians, and how Lithuanians are represented. Their group appears in bold red colors that stand out against the pale blues of the Poles and browns of the Russians, and is one of the brightest colors on the entire map. By emphasizing the population and unique history of Lithuanians by highlighting different groups and his choice of a bold color, Gabrys revealed some of his political and personal biases.</p>\n<p>Gabrys wanted Lithuanians to be internationally recognized as a large and powerful ethnic group that deserved its own nation, separate from surrounding countries. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> By 1918, when his <em>Carte Ethnographique de l’Europe</em> was published, Gabrys had already organized multiple conferences in France that brought together people from around the world to make their own claims about ethnicity and nation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ultimately, Gabrys used this ethnographic map to argue that Europe had natural, ethnic borders that should dictate its new political borders to secure international peace.

Having witnessed the Mexican American War that ended in 1848, when the United States forced Mexico to cede almost one-third of its territory, García Cubas recognized the influential role national maps could play in disputes over territory and nation. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Take, for example, García Cubas’s 1863 <em>Carta general de la República</em>. Usually, we think of borders as being made up of one line. Yet this map has two northern borders. Measuring almost 4 feet by 5 feet, this map was the first national map of Mexico made in Mexico by a Mexican cartographer. García Cubas presented a unified nation, and he made an argument about the relationship between the Untied States and Mexico by including two different northern borders of Mexico. One border is marked by text, in Spanish, that reads “Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,” and includes the area known as the Mesilla Valley. The other is marked with “Treaty of La Mesilla” and is highlighted in red, following the contours of present-day Mexico.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://storiiies.cogapp.com/embed/0d6rb/Carta-General\" title=\"Carta General\"></iframe>\nOther versions of the map did not contain this double border. In the 1858 version, which was included in an atlas, García Cubas only outlined in red a single northern border and the map makes no mention of either the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo or Treaty of La Mesilla. <figure id=\"carta-general-58\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#carta-general-58\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/cartageneral58.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Antonio García Cubas <em>Carta general de la República Mexicana</em>, 1858.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">David Rumsey Historical Map Collection</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/cartageneral58.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Antonio García Cubas <em>Carta general de la República Mexicana</em>, 1858.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">David Rumsey Historical Map Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure> The difference between the atlas and the 1863 version perhaps suggests that Antonio García Cubas wanted to make a point about the power of cartography and Mexico as a nation when his map was published in larger format.
