[{"content":"<p><em>“One can make a map without shades and colors, but not without lines”</em><br>\n<em>-Erwin Raisz</em>, Principles of Cartography</p>\n<p>Lines are foundational to how maps communicate. Take, for instance, the map on your smart phone. To guide you between two places, the map shows one line and encourages you to ignore everything else. Mapmakers’ choices about the placement, density, and purpose of lines combine to make maps seem simple and objective— just follow this line and you’ll have everything you need. But these lines are rarely as straightforward as they seem. This exhibition follows lines on maps to their extremes in examples from seemingly mundane textbooks to avant-garde art. Through these lines, maps rationalize their world view, even as they reveal perspectives that are neither universal nor neutral.</p>\n<p>The exhibition’s seven sections each delve into a fundamental kind of line on maps as they developed in Europe and the Americas.

As these instructional texts illustrate, lines can have a variety of functions, even within one specific kind of map. A thin line may mark a minor road; an undulating line may track a river; and a straight line along the edges will often give the map itself a border. Although these lines now seem obvious, mapmakers developed these conventionalized, but still flexible, symbols slowly over time. By codifying these symbols, instructional texts like these spread a European tradition of mapping throughout the world.</p>\n<p>The amazing variety in types of lines is most apparent in texts that explicitly teach mapmaking, a few of which you can see in the examples below.</p>\n<figure id=\"conventionalsigns2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#conventionalsigns2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><canvas-panel canvas-id=\"https://collections.newberry.org/IIIF3/Presentation/Canvas/2KXJ8Z8P40BF7\" choice-id=\"\" height=\"\" iiif-content=\"\" manifest-id=\"https://collections.newberry.org/IIIF3/Presentation/Canvas/2KXJ8Z8P40BF7\" preset=\"responsive\" region=\"0,0,undefined,undefined\" virtual-sizes=\"\" width=\"\"> </canvas-panel></a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">From  <em>Manual of Topography and Text-book Of Tropographical Drawing; For the Use of Officers of the Army and Navy, Civil Engineers, Academies, Colleges, and Schools of Science</em> by Joseph Enthoffer, 1870.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Newberry Library</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">From  <em>Manual of Topography and Text-book Of Tropographical Drawing; For the Use of Officers of the Army and Navy, Civil Engineers, Academies, Colleges, and Schools of Science</em> by Joseph Enthoffer, 1870.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Newberry Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p><em>Institutions Standardize Map Lines</em></p>\n<p>In this U.S. Coast Survey manual, engraver Joseph Entoffer carefully detailed the colors, shapes, and types of lines mapmakers should use to mark features important for military purposes.

Short, thick strokes show a steep pitch and long, thin strokes show a gradual incline.

Published in 1918, around the time of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the first World War, this period was a tumultuous time for national borders in Europe. State officials, scientists, and academics believed that peace could be secured and that any lingering conflicts could be solved through the ethnographic map. As early as 1914, France began to set up geographical commissions to start charting potential territorial issues and creating ethnographic maps with the intention of using them as major aids in decision making during peace negotiations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Ethnographic maps like the <em>Carte Ethnographique</em> claimed to be objective but were influenced by the political beliefs of their creators, the needs of the state, and flaws in statistical sciences and data collection in this period.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Looking at the <em>Carte Ethnographique</em>, notice which groups are labeled, the size of their territorial claims, and what colors Gabrys chose to represent them.

Having witnessed the Mexican American War that ended in 1848, when the United States forced Mexico to cede almost one-third of its territory, García Cubas recognized the influential role national maps could play in disputes over territory and nation. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Take, for example, García Cubas’s 1863 <em>Carta general de la República</em>.

Measuring almost 4 feet by 5 feet, this map was the first national map of Mexico made in Mexico by a Mexican cartographer. García Cubas presented a unified nation, and he made an argument about the relationship between the Untied States and Mexico by including two different northern borders of Mexico. One border is marked by text, in Spanish, that reads “Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,” and includes the area known as the Mesilla Valley. The other is marked with “Treaty of La Mesilla” and is highlighted in red, following the contours of present-day Mexico.</p>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://storiiies.cogapp.com/embed/0d6rb/Carta-General\" title=\"Carta General\"></iframe>\nOther versions of the map did not contain this double border.

The US General Land Office used this method to create standardized parcels of land that could be easily sold as part of the US colonial project of westward expansion. But geographic features—like rivers—and older administrative systems—like parishes established by the French—disrupted this seemingly simple grid. Up close, these ruptures unsettled the order projected from afar.</p>\n","length":69,"title":"The (Mostly) Rectangular Survey","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/boundaries/b3/"},{"content":"<p>Rhumb lines gave a rational order to the mysterious depths. From the Spanish <em>rumbo</em> for a defined path, the rhumb line directed mariners along a constant cardinal direction. Guided by a rhumb line, a captain could set a course using just a compass, which was crucial when measuring longitude at sea was almost impossible. Rhumb lines were so important for so long that by the eighteenth century they were simply part of how many maps depicted water. For centuries, maps that were never made to go to sea or even to plan sea routes still incorporated rhumb lines because readers would be confused without them.</p>\n","length":105,"title":"Rhumb Lines","type":"table-of-contents","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/rhumb%20lines/"},{"content":"<p>Rhumb lines are supposed to guide you. But they can be overwhelming at the poles where every line of longitude intersect at one point. Although the rhumb lines on Mount and Page’s map are straight, seemingly straightforward lines, they quickly overpower all other information at sea so that you might almost forget you’re looking at a map at all.</p>\n","length":59,"title":"Lines All Over the Map","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/rhumb%20lines/r1/"},{"content":"<p>Swirling and converging on the North Pole in Jansson’s map, the rhumb lines turn into a geometric abstraction.</p>\n","length":18,"title":"Lines All Over the Map (part 2)","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/rhumb%20lines/r2/"},{"content":"<p>This page includes a large map and two inset maps with north, as the compass roses show, in different directions on each map. But the rhumb lines blithely extend beneath the insets’ borders and connect these compasses. With little warning, what is southwest in Lapland becomes northwest near the Kosa river! The mapmaker’s loyalty to what a map with rhumb lines should look like undermines the meaning of the lines themselves.</p>\n","length":71,"title":"It’s Not You, It’s the Line","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/rhumb%20lines/r3/"},{"content":"<p>Even when we cannot see them, graticules provide the basis for modern mapping. Encompassing the whole grid created by perpendicular lines of longitude and latitude, graticules are the scaffolding that holds the rest of the map in place. The re-introduction of Claudius Ptolemy’s system for mapping with graticules fundamentally changed how Europeans created maps beginning in the 15th century. Ptolemy’s methods led to centuries of experimentation with mathematical projections. With different projections of the sphere of the Earth onto a flat piece of paper, this grid bends and stretches to preserve the mathematical relationship between locations on the map.</p>\n","length":99,"title":"Graticules","type":"table-of-contents","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/graticules/"},{"content":"<p>Like a skeleton in the back of an anatomy classroom, this map shows how the world is put together without showing the living matter. As part of a series that demonstrates how graticules move within different map projections, the only straight lines in this particular projection are the equator and the central line of longitude. Out of context, though, its lines are reminiscent of an abstract spirograph drawing.</p>\n","length":68,"title":"How to Rule the World","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/graticules/g1/"},{"content":"<p>A prominent mapmaker in Verona, Italy, Paulo Forlani helped popularize what we now think of as a standard world map: one that is oval or rectangular and held together by parallel, horizontal lines and sloping vertical lines. Emphasizing these lines on the map both helped people take advantage of the map’s mathematical qualities and also assured users that the map was accurate and trustworthy.</p>\n","length":64,"title":"Longitude and Latitude Become Popular","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/graticules/g2/"},{"content":"<p>The flexibility of graticules and the mathematical basis of map projections allowed mapmakers to tailor their maps to specific needs. This map, for instance, centers the whole world on Paris. Its lengthy text explains how to precisely measure the distance between the French capital and any place on the globe using measurements of longitude and latitude. This structure made the whole world appear as something you could know without getting up from a comfortable chair overlooking the Seine.</p>\n","length":78,"title":"Measuring the World","type":"entry","url":"http://localhost:8080/catalogue/graticules/g3/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Bibliography","type":"bibliography","url":"http://localhost:8080/bibliography/"},{"content":"<ul class='quire-contributors-list bio align-left'>             <li class=\"quire-contributor\" id=\"david-weimer\">   <div class=\"title is-5\">     <span class=\"quire-contributor__name\">David Weimer</span>     <a href=\"https://www.newberry.org/news/david-weimer-joins-the-newberry-as-curator-of-maps\" class=\"quire-contributor__url\" target=\"_blank\"  > <svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\"> <switch> <use xlink:href=\"#link-icon\"></use> </switch> </svg> </a>   </div>   <div class=\"media\">     <div class=\"quire-contributor__details media-content\">        <div class=\"quire-contributor__bio\">         David Weimer is the Robert A.
