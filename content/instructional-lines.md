We have expectations for what lines on maps mean—a highlighted line on an app on a smartphone shows the fastest path of travel, or dark, solid lines mark boundaries between countries, for example. But lines on maps have evolved consistently throughout history, responding to events such as technological revolutions, as with the rise of computing technologies that allow cartographers to map our world in new ways and on different scales. As the following instructional texts illustrate, lines can have a variety of meanings, even on one specific kind of map. Mapmakers have carefully considered what lines on maps should look like and how these highly conventionalized symbols should be taught, practiced, and learned.

*Institutions Standardize Map Lines*

In this U.S. Coast Survey manual, engraver Joseph Entoffer carefully detailed the colors, shapes, and types of lines mapmakers should use to mark features important for military purposes. To help standardize surveys of thousands of miles of territory, federal and military institutions funded and published atlases, manuals, and textbooks as a guide. Manuals like Entoffer’s highlight that what may seem like universal cartographic principles were purposefully designed by past mapmakers.

*Technology and Experts Shape Standards*

This textbook classifies important graphic elements of maps, instructing how to best represent the hue, shape, and spacing of lines. Elsewhere, the authors comment that cartography is a rapidly growing field because of evolving techniques and innovations in technology for data gathering and machine processing. Published over 100 years after Entoffer’s manual, this textbook is an example of how scholars and scientific disciplines continually standardized and updated cartographic knowledge, down to the level of lines.
