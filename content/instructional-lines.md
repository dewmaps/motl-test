Numerous small and large variations in lines allow mapmakers to communicate all sorts of facts, stories, and concepts. As these instructional texts illustrate, lines can have a variety of functions, even within one specific kind of map. A thin line may mark a minor road; an undulating line may track a river; and a straight line along the edges will often give the map itself a border. Although these lines now seem obvious, mapmakers developed these conventionalized, but still flexible, symbols slowly over time. By codifying these symbols, instructional texts like these spread a European tradition of mapping throughout the world.  

The amazing variety in types of lines is most apparent in texts that explicitly teach mapmaking, a few of which you can see in the examples below.

*Institutions Standardize Map Lines*

In this U.S. Coast Survey manual, engraver Joseph Entoffer carefully detailed the colors, shapes, and types of lines mapmakers should use to mark features important for military purposes. To help standardize surveys of thousands of miles of territory, federal and military institutions funded and published atlases, manuals, and textbooks as a guide. Manuals like Entoffer’s highlight that what may seem like universal cartographic principles were purposefully designed by past mapmakers.

Even as institutions evolved, they continued to standardize lines. Almost a century after Entoffer published his work with the U.S. Coast Survey, another federal agency, the U.S. Geological Survey continued to create topographic maps of the country. In the large surveys spanning thousands of sheets created by the U.S. Geological Survey, mapmakers and readers alike needed reminders of the subtle differences in lines. Responding to changes in technology and new mapping needs resulting from the second World War, such as aerial photography, mapmakers added their own recommendations on how to best use lines.

*Technology and Experts Shape Standards*

This textbook classifies important graphic elements of maps, instructing how to best represent the hue, shape, and spacing of lines. Elsewhere, the authors comment that cartography is a rapidly growing field because of evolving techniques and innovations in technology for data gathering and machine processing. Published over 100 years after Entoffer’s manual, this textbook is an example of how scholars and scientific disciplines continually standardized and updated cartographic knowledge, down to the level of lines.
