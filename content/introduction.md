Here, you can write in Markdown, which is a simple, plain-text markup language that uses basic symbols, such as hash marks, asterisks, and brackets, to format content for easy conversion into HTML. 

Here are some of the things you can do with Markdown:

    Add italics to a word or phrase by surrounding it with single asterisks: *a phrase in italics*.
    Add bold to a word or phrase by surrounding it with double asterisks: **a phrase in bold**.
    Add a second-level heading by putting the text on itâ€™s own line, preceded by two hashmarks: ## Heading 2.
    Add a link by putting the link text in square brackets followed by the URL in parentheses: [click here] (http://www.myurl.com).

You can also use footnotes in your text using Markdown, which will appear at the bottom of the page.
