Not all lines on maps are made by a cartographer. When maps are repeatedly folded and unfolded and stuffed into pockets on trips, they develop another grid of lines just as enduring as those in ink. These lines remind us that maps are always living objects that carry their own imperfections and histories. For contemporary artists, these inkless lines evoke the unwritten rules that have shaped heavily segregated cities like Chicago and Detroit. Redlining, a term that refers to policies of race-based housing discrimination in US cities, is rarely visible as a bright line on a map. Like lines from folds, lines of segregation and discrimination instead only become visible when we understand how people actually live in these cities.
