In the Folded Map Project, [Tonika Johnson](https://www.foldedmapproject.com/) uses a map of Chicago folded along Madison Street to explore segregation. Streets across the whole city are numbered north and south from Madison Street in the Loop. This system creates sets of address pairs like the 6900 block of North Ashland in Rogers Park and the 6900 block of South Ashland in West Englewood, which Johnson uses as a structure to unpack the ongoing legacy of segregation in Chicago. Her work prompts us to consider how we can take action to shape our cities today.
