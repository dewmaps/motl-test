A neat street grid in a folded road map may tame a bustling city, but an unruly river is harder to control. Instead of fighting the bends of the river, this German agency decided to let the map follow the river rather than the river adjust to the map. Through a series of carefully engineered folds, this map pours out into the shape of a sixty-mile section of the Danube, between Isarm√ºndung and Regensburg.
