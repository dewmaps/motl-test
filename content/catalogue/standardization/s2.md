Even as institutions evolved, they continued to standardize lines. Almost a century after Joseph Entoffer published his work with the U.S. Coast Survey, another federal agency, the U.S. Geological Survey continued to create topographic maps of the country. In the large surveys spanning thousands of sheets created by the U.S. Geological Survey, mapmakers and readers alike needed reminders of the subtle differences in lines. Responding to changes in technology and new mapping needs resulting from the second World War, such as aerial photography, mapmakers added their own recommendations on how to best use lines.
