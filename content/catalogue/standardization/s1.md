In this U.S. Coast Survey manual, engraver Joseph Entoffer carefully detailed the colors, shapes, and types of lines mapmakers should use to mark features important for military purposes. To help standardize surveys of thousands of miles of territory, federal and military institutions funded and published atlases, manuals, and textbooks as a guide. Manuals like Entofferâ€™s highlight that what may seem like universal cartographic principles were purposefully designed by past mapmakers.
