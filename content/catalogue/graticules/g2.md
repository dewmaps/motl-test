Like a skeleton in the back of an anatomy classroom, this map shows how the world is put together without showing the living matter. As part of a series that demonstrates how graticules move within different map projections, the only straight lines in this particular projection are the equator and the central line of longitude. Out of context, though, its lines are reminiscent of an abstract spirograph drawing.
