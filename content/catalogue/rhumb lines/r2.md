Early European mapmakers began to include rhumb lines in nautical charts for navigators to use to follow a trajectory along or parallel to a single line. But some of these charts, and later atlases, were ornately decorated and never left the cozy fireside. Swirling and converging on the North Pole in Janssonâ€™s map, the rhumb lines turn into a geometric abstraction, showing how rhumb lines could work as a decorative element rather than just as a tool that sailors would actually use to navigate the world.
