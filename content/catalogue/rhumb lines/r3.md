This page includes a large map and two inset maps with north, as the compass roses show, in different directions on each map. But the rhumb lines blithely extend beneath the insets’ borders and connect these compasses. With little warning, what is southwest in Lapland becomes northwest near the Kosa river! The mapmaker’s loyalty to what a map with rhumb lines should look like undermines the meaning of the lines themselves.
