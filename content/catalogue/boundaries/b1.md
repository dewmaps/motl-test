This map of Europe, showing different ethnic and national groups marked in various shades, was created by Lithuanian politician Juozas Gabrys. Published in 1918, around the time of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the first World War, this period was a tumultuous time for national borders in Europe. State officials, scientists, and academics believed that peace could be secured and that any lingering conflicts could be solved through the ethnographic map. As early as 1914, France began to set up geographical commissions to start charting potential territorial issues and creating ethnographic maps with the intention of using them as major aids in decision making during peace negotiations.[^1] 

Ethnographic maps like the *Carte Ethnographique* claimed to be objective but were influenced by the political beliefs of their creators, the needs of the state, and flaws in statistical sciences and data collection in this period. For example, German mapmakers continually struggled to define who would count as German when collecting census data and representing that on maps—should birthplace or current citizenship determine whether someone was categorically German? Did either of those characteristics mean that someone felt belonging or loyalty to a German state? [^3]  

Looking at the *Carte Ethnographique*, notice which groups are labeled, the size of their territorial claims, and what colors Gabrys chose to represent them. Examine the size of Lithuanian territory and the variety in types of Lithuanians, and how Lithuanians are represented. Their group appears in bold red colors that stand out against the pale blues of the Poles and browns of the Russians, and is one of the brightest colors on the entire map. By emphasizing the population and unique history of Lithuanians by highlighting different groups and his choice of a bold color, Gabrys revealed some of his political and personal biases.  

Gabrys wanted Lithuanians to be internationally recognized as a large and powerful ethnic group that deserved its own nation, separate from surrounding countries. He had been politically active before the first World War and played an important role in Lithuanian nationalist movements as in 1905, when he was an active part of the Lithuanian revolution against Russia and had to flee in the following year. By 1910, he had written several books about Lithuania, hoping to show to his readers that Lithuania had a unique history and a distinct culture that merited a separate nation.[^4] In 1911, Gabrys founded the Offices des Nationalités in 1911 to give Lithuanians and other ethnic minorities, who he saw as oppressed by larger countries, a chance to express their identities and problems. By 1918, when his *Carte Ethnographique de l’Europe* was published, Gabrys had already organized multiple conferences in France that brought together people from around the world to make their own claims about ethnicity and nation.[^5] 

Viewing the map as a whole, the contemporary borders of European nations, outlined in black dotted lines, do not match up with the lines or shapes marking ethnic groups and nationalities. Some groups had more than 12 different nationalities within their borders, such as Russia, and other countries with relatively cohesive ethnic groups were missing parts of their group as it fanned out into a different nation, like Italy. By spatializing these relationships on his map, Gabrys made ethnic groups more visible and emphasized that political borders on maps did not always reflect the reality of the world.
