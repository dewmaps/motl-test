> *“con más razón aún nostoros pordríamos decir, que nuestra historia está escrita con sólo decir que México y los Estados Unidos son vecinos. A lo menos la Francia y la Inglaterra están separadas por el canal de la Mancha; entre nuestra nación y la vecina no existe otro lindero que una simple línea matemática………..¡Dios salve á la República!!!*” -Antonio García Cubas, **Diccionario geográfico, histórico y biográfico de los Estado Unidos Mexicanos**, 1898

Writing toward the end of his career, Antonio García Cubas, one of the most important cartographers of Mexico, expressed concern over the lack of a clear, natural geographic border between Mexico and a land-hungry United States to the north. Having witnessed the Mexican American War that ended in 1848, when the United States forced Mexico to cede almost one-third of its territory, García Cubas recognized the influential role national maps could play in disputes over territory and nation. [^1] 

Take, for example, García Cubas’s 1863 *Carta general de la República*. Usually, we think of borders as being made up of one line. Yet this map has two northern borders. Measuring almost 4 feet by 5 feet, this map was the first national map of Mexico made in Mexico by a Mexican cartographer. García Cubas presented a unified nation, and he made an argument about the relationship between the Untied States and Mexico by including two different northern borders of Mexico. One border is marked by text, in Spanish, that reads “Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo,” and includes the area known as the Mesilla Valley. The other is marked with “Treaty of La Mesilla” and is highlighted in red, following the contours of present-day Mexico.

Other versions of the map did not contain this double border. In the 1858 version, which was included in an atlas, García Cubas only outlined in red a single northern border and the map makes no mention of either the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo or Treaty of La Mesilla. {% figure 'carta-general-58' %} The difference between the atlas and the 1863 version perhaps suggests that Antonio García Cubas wanted to make a point about the power of cartography and Mexico as a nation when his map was published in larger format. By presenting Mexico as a complete nation with natural borders, García Cubas argued that other nations like the U.S. should respect its territorial claims.
