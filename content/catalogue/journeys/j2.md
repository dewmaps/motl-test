Strip maps that depicted a single journey line continued to be popular, especially in the 20th century with the rise in popularity of the automobile and the growing tourism industry. As in *Britannia*, the orienting points on the map are not north and south, but instead the journey’s start and end. This guidebook for México uses journeys to portray the country as united along convenient lines, easily traversable by tourists via automobile.
