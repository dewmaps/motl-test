This strip map from the 20th century continued the tradition begun by Ogilby in *Britannia*. The orienting points on the map are not north and south, but instead the journey’s start and end. This guidebook for México uses journeys to portray the country as united along convenient lines, easily traversable by tourists via automobile.
