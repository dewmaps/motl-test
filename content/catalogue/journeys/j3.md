On board James Ross’ expedition to the Antarctic in the early 1840s, John Edward Davis meticulously tracked the progress of the journey while noting new coastal and glacial features and routes of other recent expeditions. His hand-drawn lines extend and intersect lines printed on the map of past expeditions as far back as James Cook in the 1770s. In these annotations, printed and manuscript lines blend together in the accretion of scientific knowledge in harsh conditions.
