If Chicago were a symphony, who would perform it? With this unconventional score, Composer John Cage invites us to listen to the city. Each line on the map connects randomly generated addresses—labeled quicksteps, waltzes, and marches for the number of beats in a measure. But Cage gave no instructions on how to use these lines and addresses. What you hear is the exhibition curators’ interpretation of just a few of the 128 lines.
