The practice of using journey lines to connect a tripâ€™s start and end points as a continuous path grew in popularity in Europe starting in the seventeenth century. Journey lines both facilitated new means of travel and were integrated into the increasingly popular genre of travel literature.

In doing so, the journey line offers a tool for exploring the relationship between time, geography, and shared, human experience.
